# How to run this game

1.  Currently a local server is required to run the game
2.  Install Node.js at [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3.  Once the node.js software is installed, you will need to use a command prompt in Windows, change directory to the directory where your files are located. Once you're in this directory, you can run the command which will establish the current directory as the folder which will be seen as the local web server's document folder. Make sure that you load this with the following command and options - the option -c-1 will ensure that files are not cached which will help you during the testing.<br> **http-server -c-1**
4.  Once this is done, your browser can address this local server by using the URL based on your new web page location, e.g. <br> http://localhost:8080/index.html
